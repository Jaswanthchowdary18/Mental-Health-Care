**🌿 Overview**

The Mental Health Chatbot is a web-based application designed to promote mental wellness and emotional awareness. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it uses Google’s Gemini API to engage users in empathetic, conversational dialogue — offering supportive responses, mood-based insights, and self-care suggestions.

**💡 Features**

🗣️ Conversational AI: Uses Gemini API to generate intelligent, compassionate responses.

💬 Mood-based Questions: Starts by asking basic questions (age, gender, location, and mood) to personalize interaction.

🌈 Simple & Calm UI: Clean interface built with HTML and CSS to create a comforting chat experience.

⚡ Real-time Interaction: JavaScript handles chat flow and dynamically displays both user and bot messages.

🔒 Privacy First: No data storage — user inputs stay within the browser session.
